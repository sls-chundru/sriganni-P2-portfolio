songs are more likely to reach the final stages and potentially win the competition. Steps to Investigate the Hypothesis Identify the Outcome of Interest:\nOutcome: Whether a contestant wins the competition or not. Main Predictor: The number of songs performed by the contestant.\nData Preparation: Create a dataset with contestants’ information, including the number of songs they performed and their final position in the competition. Create a binary variable indicating whether a contestant won the competition (1 for the winner, 0 for others).\nExploratory Data Analysis: Visualize the distribution of the number of songs performed by winners and other contestants. Perform statistical tests to check for significant differences in the number of songs performed between winners and other contestants.\nModel Building: Build a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of winning based on the number of songs performed. Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.\nInterpretation: Analyze the model coefficients and interpret the relationship between the number of songs performed and the likelihood of winning.\nR Code for Data Preparation and Hypothesis Testing:\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(caret)\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\n\n\nAttaching package:

contestants on American Idol using historical data spanning 18 seasons. The goal was to uncover trends and patterns by filtering, aggregating, and visualizing the data. Key steps included loading and exploring datasets, summarizing dataframes, and creating visualizations to understand contestant numbers, viewership trends, and song performances. I also tested the hypothesis that contestants performing more songs are more likely to reach the final stages and potentially win the competition. This involved creating a dataset with contestant information, visualizing song performance distributions, and building logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine models.\nThe findings supported the hypothesis, indicating that contestants performing more songs tend to progress further in the competition. Visualizations showed variations in contestant numbers per season, viewership trends, and top contestants by the number of songs performed. Certain cities consistently produced more contestants who advanced to Hollywood, highlighting regional talent hubs. Model evaluations revealed that logistic regression and random forest models performed well, with high accuracy and reasonable ROC AUC, while the SVM model showed lower performance. Overall, the analysis provided valuable insights into American Idol contestant performances and the relationship between song numbers and competition success."

The p-value suggests that this effect is not statistically significant, implying there might be no strong linear relationship between income and height.\n3.Eye Color Blue (-15.7, p-value = 0.448): This coefficient suggests that individuals with blue eyes are, on average, 15.7 units shorter than the reference eye color category. The high p-value indicates that this difference is not statistically significant.\n4.Eye Color Brown (-2.21, p-value = 0.921): Similar to blue, having brown eyes correlates with being 2.21 units shorter than the reference group, but this is also not statistically significant.\n5.Eye Color Green (-0.95, p-value = 0.966): This result suggests almost no difference in height compared to the reference eye color, and the effect is not statistically significant.\n6.Eye Color Hazel (10.1, p-value = 0.666): This suggests that individuals with hazel eyes are on average 10.1 units taller than the reference group, although this is not statistically significant.\nThe model suggests that neither income nor eye color has a statistically significant effect on height, based on the p-values associated with each predictor. This implies that variations in height within this dataset are likely due to factors not included in this model. The overall effectiveness of the model in predicting height based on these variables might be limited, indicating potential need for considering other variables or a different modeling approach. # References"

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/venkata/Documents/GitHub/sriganni-P2-portfolio/starter-analysis-exercise\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

The data is collected from the historical presidential poll data for Biden and Trump starting from February 27, 2020. The data is filtered, and averages are computed to create an interactive plot using the highcharter library. The plot displays the poll percentages for both candidates over time with a rolling average to smooth out fluctuations. The chart also includes scatter points for the individual poll data and annotations highlighting the latest average poll percentages for both candidates. This visualization offers a clear view of the polling trends leading up to the 2020 presidential election.\nThe Original copy of this plot can be found here : https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2020/national/."

My background is in chemical engineering with industry experience focused on chemical testing of water and waste water. I am passionate about data analysis and I am looking forward to work in the field of data analytics. As part of my Data Analytics Journey so far I have worked with R, python, SQL and SAS. I have explored machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, natural learning processing, clustering and regression. I have also worked on data visualization using ggplot2 and matplotlib. I have experience in data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, statistical analysis and machine learning.\nData Analytics Experience\nI have previously worked on projects focused on analysis of resources available for cancer patients. I am also working on a project which is focused on predicting the price of housing market in San Antonio. I am looking forward to work on more projects and gain more experience in the field of data analytics. I am also looking forward to work on projects which are focused on data visualization and machine learning. I am also interested in learning new technologies and tools in the field of data analytics.\nResearch Interest\nMy Primary area of interest is to work at the intersection of data analytics and chemical engineering. Specially application of machine learning techniques to analyze and discover underlying trends in chemical plant data and material testing.\nInteresting thing About Me\nA quirky and interesting thing about me is My passion for photography, especially focusing on capturing nature and landscapes. It offered a different perspective on observing and interpreting the world around me.\nHobbies\nI love playing Racquetball, trekking and passionate about Photography.\nMachine Learning & Art: Neural Networks for Artistic Use(Link)\nThis video tutorial provides an in-depth look at how neural networks can be used to apply artistic styles to images, a process known as style transfer. It’s a compelling example of how machine learning techniques are being used creatively to blend different artistic styles onto a canvas or photograph, essentially allowing the algorithm to “paint” one picture in the style of another artist."

I am eager to work on more projects to enhance my experience in data analytics, especially those focusing on data visualization and machine learning.\n\n\nProjects\n\nCancer Patient health resources Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing Market Trends Modeling\n\n\n\nNatural Langugage Processing\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interest\nMy primary area of interest lies at the intersection of data analytics and chemical engineering. Specifically, I am keen on applying machine learning techniques to analyze and discover underlying trends in chemical plant data and material testing.\n\n\nHobbies\nIn my free time, I love playing Racquetball, trekking, and I am passionate about photography."

The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the results folder.\nIt’s the same code done 3 times:\n\nFirst, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.\nSecond, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.\nThird, my current favorite, is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.\n\nThe last version has the advantage of having code in one place for easy writing/debugging, and then being able to pull the code into the Quarto file for a nice combination of text/commentary and code.\nEach way of doing this is a reasonable approach, pick whichever one you prefer or makes the most sense for your setup. Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/venkata/Documents/GitHub/sriganni-P2-portfolio/starter-analysis-exercise\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

The ResNet50 model, deployed in TensorFlow, identified the type of vehicle in each image. This data was then used to create a frequency distribution table for the vehicle types present in the dataset. We combined this data with fuel economy figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The resulting analysis allowed us to calculate the fuel consumption and GHG footprint of the fleet, broken down by vehicle and fuel types.

The ResNet50 model, deployed in TensorFlow, identified the type of vehicle in each image. This data was then used to create a frequency distribution table for the vehicle types present in the dataset. We combined this data with fuel economy figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The resulting analysis allowed us to calculate the fuel consumption and GHG footprint of the fleet, broken down by vehicle and fuel types. Figure shows the flowchart of the overall process implemented in the project :"

    "text": "Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that commercial vehicles and pickup trucks have up to 50% higher fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to cars. The visualizations support this by showing that limousines and cabs have the highest annual gasoline and diesel consumption, followed closely by pickup trucks. The high fuel consumption of commercial vehicles is due to their higher mileage, while pickup trucks have higher fuel consumption due to lower efficiency.\nAdditionally, the plots indicate that vehicles like sports cars and beach wagons have lower fuel consumption compared to commercial vehicles and pickup trucks. Diesel vehicles within the same category are shown to be more efficient than gasoline vehicles, leading to better fuel economy and relatively lower CO2 emissions. The bar plots for CO2 emissions from gasoline and diesel consumption reinforce the finding that limousines and cabs emit the most CO2, followed by pickup trucks, sports cars, and beach wagons.\nThe specific insights from the plots are as follows:\nAnnual Gasoline Consumption: Limousines and cabs show the highest consumption, followed by pickup trucks.\nAnnual Diesel Consumption: Limousines and cabs again lead in consumption, with pickup trucks also showing significant diesel use.\nCO2 Emissions from Gasoline: Limousines and cabs produce the most emissions, followed by pickup trucks and sports cars.\nCO2 Emissions from Diesel: Limousines and cabs remain the highest emitters, with pickup trucks and sports cars also contributing significantly.\nThese findings highlight the higher environmental impact of commercial vehicles and pickup trucks compared to other vehicle types.\nWe successfully identified vehicle types from the given image data set and quantified their distribution by type using Resnet in tensorflow environment. Additionally, we classified the vehicles based on their fuel type, allowing us to assess the fuel economy of gasoline and diesel vehicles using summary statistics and scatter plots. The EPA data was instrumental in converting frequency distribution data into actual fuel economy figures and GHG emissions. This tool can be further refined to efficiently quantify fuel consumption and related expenses using images of existing vehicle fleets. Its capability to process images also makes it adaptable for analyzing real-time traffic camera data to quantify GHG emissions and pollution levels in urban environments."

    "text": "Brief Decription of the Data:\nTitle: NCHS - Death rates and life expectancy at birth\nDescription: we will explore a dataset from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) that contains information about death rates and life expectancy at birth. Our goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and summarize the variables by their distributions.\nThis dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth by race and sex.\nAge-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

The frequency decreases as the death rate increases, indicating fewer occurrences at higher death rates.This visualization helps identify the concentration and spread of death rates within the population, highlighting areas with the most common and least common death rates.\n\n\n\n\ndeath_rate_summary &lt;- selected_data %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean = mean(`Age-adjusted Death Rate`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd = sd(`Age-adjusted Death Rate`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nprint(death_rate_summary)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n   mean    sd\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1593.  682.\n\n\nThe summary statistics table provides the mean and standard deviation for the age-adjusted death rates. The mean age-adjusted death rate is approximately 1593.06, with a standard deviation of 682.37.

Sexes and Females but slightly larger for Males, indicating more variability in the male category.\n3.There are several outliers in the Male category, suggesting that there are some instances of unusually high death rates.\nThis visualization highlights the differences in death rates among the sex categories, with males showing higher median and more variability in death rates.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(selected_data, aes(x = Race, y = `Average Life Expectancy (Years)`, fill = Race)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Average Life Expectancy by Race\", x =

I then performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the synthetic data, producing summary statistics, histograms, and boxplots to compare with the original data. This approach helps ensure the synthetic data closely mimics the characteristics and distributions of the original data, enabling further analysis and modeling.\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning: I started by loading Sri’s original data and renaming columns to avoid spaces, which synthpop requires for generating synthetic data correctly.\nSynthetic Data Generation: Using the synthpop package, I generated a synthetic dataset based on the original data. The synthetic data retains the structure and distribution of the original dataset.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted a similar EDA on the synthetic data as Sri did on the original data, including summary statistics, histograms, and boxplots.\nComparison: The EDA of the synthetic data closely mirrors the original data, demonstrating that the synthetic data maintains similar distributions and relationships among variables. This is crucial for ensuring that any analysis or modeling performed on the synthetic data would yield results similar to those obtained from the original data.\n\nBy generating and analyzing synthetic data, I can share and analyze sensitive datasets without compromising privacy, ensuring that the synthetic data provides a reliable stand-in for the original dataset. This approach allows us to conduct meaningful analyses and derive insights while protecting the confidentiality of the original data."
