The p-value suggests that this effect is not statistically significant, implying there might be no strong linear relationship between income and height.\n3.Eye Color Blue (-15.7, p-value = 0.448): This coefficient suggests that individuals with blue eyes are, on average, 15.7 units shorter than the reference eye color category. The high p-value indicates that this difference is not statistically significant.\n4.Eye Color Brown (-2.21, p-value = 0.921): Similar to blue, having brown eyes correlates with being 2.21 units shorter than the reference group, but this is also not statistically significant.\n5.Eye Color Green (-0.95, p-value = 0.966): This result suggests almost no difference in height compared to the reference eye color, and the effect is not statistically significant.\n6.Eye Color Hazel (10.1, p-value = 0.666): This suggests that individuals with hazel eyes are on average 10.1 units taller than the reference group, although this is not statistically significant.\nThe model suggests that neither income nor eye color has a statistically significant effect on height, based on the p-values associated with each predictor. This implies that variations in height within this dataset are likely due to factors not included in this model. The overall effectiveness of the model in predicting height based on these variables might be limited, indicating potential need for considering other variables or a different modeling approach. # References"

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/venkata/Documents/GitHub/sriganni-P2-portfolio/starter-analysis-exercise\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Additionally, the low p-value ( 2.2e-16) confirms the statistical significance of this relationship, suggesting that the year is a significant predictor of temperature.\nNote: The red line in the plot provides a visual representation of the linear regression model’s prediction of how temperature anomaly changes with each passing year\nIn conclusion, after further analysis and using visualization with linear regression models, I can confirm there exist a significant relationship between increasing carbon emissions and rising temperatures. The linear regression model indicates that temperatures changes on average of 0.0068. Similarly, on average, carbon emissions increases by 6.518e+01 per year."

    "text": "The aim was to explore whether the size of a population in African countries in the year 2000 impacts life expectancy.\n\n\n\nA linear regression model was employed with life expectancy as the outcome and the population size as the predictor.\n\n\n\n\nModel Coefficients:\n\nIntercept: The model predicts a base life expectancy of 5593 years, adjusting for population size.\nLog(Population) Coefficient: The coefficient of 2.756e-08 suggests a negligible change in life expectancy with increasing population size.\n\nStatistical Significance:\n\nThe p-value for the log of population size is 0.6159, indicating that this model does not find a statistically significant impact of population size on life expectancy.\n\nModel Fit:\n\nThe R-squared value is only 0.005176, highlighting that population size explains a very small fraction of the variability in life expectancy.\nThe negative adjusted R-squared value suggests that the model does not adequately predict life expectancy and might perform worse than a model with no predictors at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis indicates that there is no significant correlation between population size and life expectancy among African countries for the year 2000. This suggests that other factors not included in this model might be more influential in determining life expectancy."

This is confirmed by the linear regression model. The high R-squared value only further confirms that the model explains a large portion of the variance in carbon emissions.

This upward trend is cause by the surge in carbon emissions. The high R-squared value of 0.7528 suggests a strong relationship between year and temperature anomaly. Additionally, the low p-value ( 2.2e-16) confirms the statistical significance of this relationship, suggesting that the year is a significant predictor of temperature.\nNote: The red line in the plot provides a visual representation of the linear regression model’s prediction of how temperature anomaly changes with each passing year\nIn conclusion, after further analysis and using visualization with linear regression models, I can confirm there exist a significant relationship between increasing carbon emissions and rising temperatures. The linear regression model indicates that temperatures changes on average of 0.0068. Similarly, on average, carbon emissions increases by 6.518e+01 per year."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

The ResNet50 model, deployed in TensorFlow, identified the type of vehicle in each image. This data was then used to create a frequency distribution table for the vehicle types present in the dataset. We combined this data with fuel economy figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The resulting analysis allowed us to calculate the fuel consumption and GHG footprint of the fleet, broken down by vehicle and fuel types.

The ResNet50 model, deployed in TensorFlow, identified the type of vehicle in each image. This data was then used to create a frequency distribution table for the vehicle types present in the dataset. We combined this data with fuel economy figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The resulting analysis allowed us to calculate the fuel consumption and GHG footprint of the fleet, broken down by vehicle and fuel types. Figure shows the flowchart of the overall process implemented in the project :"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that commercial vehicles and pickup trucks have up to 50% higher fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to cars. The visualizations support this by showing that limousines and cabs have the highest annual gasoline and diesel consumption, followed closely by pickup trucks. The high fuel consumption of commercial vehicles is due to their higher mileage, while pickup trucks have higher fuel consumption due to lower efficiency.\nAdditionally, the plots indicate that vehicles like sports cars and beach wagons have lower fuel consumption compared to commercial vehicles and pickup trucks. Diesel vehicles within the same category are shown to be more efficient than gasoline vehicles, leading to better fuel economy and relatively lower CO2 emissions. The bar plots for CO2 emissions from gasoline and diesel consumption reinforce the finding that limousines and cabs emit the most CO2, followed by pickup trucks, sports cars, and beach wagons.\nThe specific insights from the plots are as follows:\nAnnual Gasoline Consumption: Limousines and cabs show the highest consumption, followed by pickup trucks.\nAnnual Diesel Consumption: Limousines and cabs again lead in consumption, with pickup trucks also showing significant diesel use.\nCO2 Emissions from Gasoline: Limousines and cabs produce the most emissions, followed by pickup trucks and sports cars.\nCO2 Emissions from Diesel: Limousines and cabs remain the highest emitters, with pickup trucks and sports cars also contributing significantly.\nThese findings highlight the higher environmental impact of commercial vehicles and pickup trucks compared to other vehicle types.\nWe successfully identified vehicle types from the given image data set and quantified their distribution by type using Resnet in tensorflow environment. Additionally, we classified the vehicles based on their fuel type, allowing us to assess the fuel economy of gasoline and diesel vehicles using summary statistics and scatter plots. The EPA data was instrumental in converting frequency distribution data into actual fuel economy figures and GHG emissions. This tool can be further refined to efficiently quantify fuel consumption and related expenses using images of existing vehicle fleets. Its capability to process images also makes it adaptable for analyzing real-time traffic camera data to quantify GHG emissions and pollution levels in urban environments."
